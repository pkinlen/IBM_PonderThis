Here are some solutions to problems posed by IBM in their "Ponder This" series.

Each month IBM posts a puzzle up on the web and they invite people to submit solutions.
Very often the solutions can be obtained by writing some code. 
In this project here on github some code is presented that is used to find solutions.
